1.why study microbial community dynamics?

Metabolic theory ecolgy
abcteria ~17% biomass on the earth - underestimated

microbiome relatively isolated

community research

Applications for microbiome

Thermal issue makes bacteria stable (Temperature)

        predicting tem-dependent of microbial traits
        growth rate
        bacteria archaea more sensitve
        
        
Rip van winkle steroids

greater thermal sensitivity+ hotter is better+ functional diversity in bacteria-----
        accelerate
        
        

competetion and coopration change over time

warming increases thermal sensitivity of ecosysytem respiration
